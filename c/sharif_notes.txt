>>>Sharif's notes about acp<<<

acp.c works for (-1, 2, 2, 3) up to 1 billion (meaning it matches the python code)

acp.c seems to work for (-3, 5, 8, 8) up to 100 million (it finds all the ones found by the python code up to 10 million plus many more)

acp.c seems to work for (-3, 5, 8, 8) up to 1 billion (it finds all the ones
found by the python code up to 10 million and all the ones previously found by
acp.c up to 100 million plus many more).

It doesn't look like we've found X_p for (-3,5,8,8) yet even after going up to
1 billion.

Looking back at acp.-3588.100000000.txt, it seems that acp.c failed to run correctly with that packing up to 100 million (4/7/15), but worked when I ran it again today (4/16/15). Weird.
